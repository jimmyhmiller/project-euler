#Project Euler

These are my solutions to a few project euler problems. Unfortunately I'm missing some. Some of them aren't perfect and need reworking. Many of them aren't exactly doing best coding practices. This is either because 1) they are old or 2) I was focused on getting it to work and haven't cleaned them up.
